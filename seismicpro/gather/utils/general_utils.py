    Parameters
    ----------

def convert_mask_to_pick(mask, threshold, sample_interval, delay):
    """Convert a first breaks `mask` into an array of arrival times.

    The mask has shape (n_traces, trace_length), each its value represents a probability of corresponding index along
    the trace to follow the first break. A naive approach is to define the first break time index as the location of
    the first trace value exceeding the `threshold`. Unfortunately, it results in noisy predictions, so the following
    conversion procedure is proposed as it appears to be more stable:
    1. Binarize the mask according to the specified `threshold`,
    2. Find the longest sequence of ones in the `mask` for each trace and save indices of the first elements of the
       found sequences,
    3. Return an array of `samples` values corresponding to the obtained indices.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> mask = np.array([[  1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    ...                  [  0, 0, 1, 1, 1],

    >>> threshold = 0.5
    >>> convert_mask_to_pick(mask, samples, threshold)

    Parameters
    ----------
    mask : 2d np.ndarray
        An array with shape (n_traces, trace_length), with each value representing a probability of corresponding index
        along the trace to follow the first break.
    samples : 1d np.ndarray of floats
        Recording time for each trace value. Measured in milliseconds.
    threshold : float
        A threshold for trace mask value to refer its index to be either pre- or post-first break.

    Returns
    -------
    times : np.ndarray with length len(mask)
        Start time of the longest sequence with `mask` values greater than the `threshold` for each trace. Measured in
        milliseconds.
