    1. If spatial coordinates lie within the constructed convex hull, linear barycentric interpolation over

    2. Otherwise, the closest known stacking velocity in Euclidean distance is returned.

class StackingVelocity:
    """A class representing stacking velocity in a certain place of a field.

    Stacking velocity is the value of the seismic velocity obtained from the best fit of the traveltime curve by a
    hyperbola for each timestamp. It is used to correct the arrival times of reflection events in the traces for their
    varying offsets prior to stacking.

    It can be created from three different types of data by calling a corresponding `classmethod`:
    * `from_points` - create a stacking velocity from 1d arrays of times and velocities,
    * `from_file` - create a stacking velocity from a file in VFUNC format with time-velocity pairs,
    * `from_interpolator` - create a stacking velocity from a callable that returns velocity value by given time.

    However, usually a stacking velocity instance is not created directly, but is obtained as a result of calling the
    following methods:
    * :func:`~semblance.Semblance.calculate_stacking_velocity` - to run an automatic algorithm for stacking velocity
      computation,
    * :func:`VelocityCube.__call__` - to interpolate a stacking velocity at passed field coordinates given a created or
      loaded velocity cube.

    The resulting object is callable and returns stacking velocities for given times.

    Examples
    --------
    Stacking velocity can be automatically calculated for a CDP gather by its semblance:
    >>> survey = Survey(path, header_index=["INLINE_3D", "CROSSLINE_3D"], header_cols="offset")
    >>> gather = survey.sample_gather().sort(by="offset")
    >>> semblance = gather.calculate_semblance(velocities=np.linspace(1400, 5000, 200), win_size=8)
    >>> velocity = semblance.calculate_stacking_velocity()

    Or it can be interpolated from a velocity cube (loaded from a file in our case):
    >>> cube = VelocityCube(path=cube_path).create_interpolator()
    >>> velocity = cube(inline, crossline)

    Velocities used for seismic cube stacking are usually picked on a sparse grid of inlines and crosslines and then
    interpolated over the whole field in order to reduce computational costs. Such interpolation can be performed by
    `VelocityCube` class which provides an interface to obtain a stacking velocity at given spatial coordinates via its
    `__call__` method. The cube can either be loaded from a file of vertical functions or created empty and iteratively
    updated with calculated stacking velocities.

    After all velocities are added, velocity interpolator should be created. It can be done either manually by
    calling :func:`~VelocityCube.create_interpolator` method or automatically during the first call to the cube. Manual
    interpolator creation is useful when the cube should be passed to different proccesses (e.g. in a pipeline with
    prefetch with `mpc` target) since otherwise the interpolator will be independently created in all the processes.

    Examples
    --------
    The cube can either be loaded from a file:
    >>> cube = VelocityCube(path=cube_path)

    Or created empty and updated with instances of `StackingVelocity` class:
    >>> cube = VelocityCube()
    >>> velocity = StackingVelocity.from_points(times=[0, 1000, 2000, 3000], velocities=[1500, 2000, 2800, 3400],
